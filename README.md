# RW3-OPAC

<a href="http://www.readerware.com">Readerware</a> is a great tool for managing small libraries. 
Support was added for mysql and other databases in Readerware v.3, which allows an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) to be created for the library collection.

This is an independent project that supports Readerware by providing a public frontend so that others can view the contents of your library on your website.

Now updated: Feb 2019 - known issues: sort and links to author's other works are currently broken.
  * Interfaces with books, dvd, and cd databases
  * Search to find keywords in Title, Author, or Description
  * Responsive design for easy access on mobile devices

## Test Drive
Readerware is hosting a demo of this interface which you can test out at https://www.readerware.com/library/
